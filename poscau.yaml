# We just provide links for now
# We try to provide the cannonical labeling for each causet
# Note that cannonical labeling based on links will likely be different from
# canonical labeling based on relations!  I choose the former for now, even
# though that is a non-standard choice. 5jul023

# Design decisions: (goal: max simplicity given flexibility)
# * just n for 'global var'
# * preceding doc for keyword defns
# * one doc for all causets
# * allow list for causet, and l: [list]

# Questions:
# * Do we want a global tcr default?
# * Do we want a more compact name for causets?
l: list representation (to add fields)
nm: name
a: adjacency matrix
sbs: state of binary storage
ps: list of parents
aut: automorphisms (null for trivial?)
# Do I want to store alternate labelings?
# labelings associated with path??
